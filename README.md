# Statistical Methodologies with Python

This repository demonstrates the application of statistical methodologies using Python, focusing on data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Each script is designed to address specific statistical concepts, offering insights into both descriptive and inferential statistics.

## Overview

The repository includes scripts and visualizations aimed at simplifying complex statistical problems. Key areas covered include Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, regression, time series analysis, and more.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- `data-preprocessing.py`: Cleans and prepares datasets for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

### Descriptive Statistics
- `descriptive-statistics.py`: Computes measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, with visualizations for distribution analysis.

### Inferential Statistics
- `hypothesis-testing.py`: Performs t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to draw meaningful inferences from data.
- `correlation-analysis.py`: Analyzes relationships between variables using Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations.

### Regression Analysis
- `regression-analysis.py`: Implements linear and multiple regression models to predict outcomes and understand relationships.

### Bayesian Statistics
- `bayesian-statistics.py`: Demonstrates Bayesian inference methods, including prior and posterior distribution calculations.

### Time Series Analysis
- `time-series-analysis.py`: Explores trends, seasonality, and forecasts using decomposition and ARIMA modeling.

## Visualizations

The `plots` directory includes various graphs and visualizations:
- Bayesian inference visualizations (`bayesian1.png`, `bayesian2.png`).
- Time series decomposition and trend plots.
